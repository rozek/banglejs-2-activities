a series of studies and experiments with Bangle.js 2

The [Bangle.js 2](https://www.espruino.com/Bangle.js2) is the second iteration of a JavaScript-programmable smartwatch made available by the [Espruino](https://www.espruino.com/) creator [Gordon Williams](https://github.com/gfwilliams).

This repository documents a series of studies and experiments conducted by the author in the course of developing an application for the bangle.js 2 - looking at the discussions in the [Espruino forum](http://forum.espruino.com/microcosms/1424/), their outcome may be of interest to other people as well.
